Hello! Here is what you will find in the project folder:
- "Project 1 - COP 3502 - Joseph Eddy.cbp" - CodeBlocks project file
- "SAMPLE - cop3502-as1-output-eddy-joseph.txt" - a sample of the output you will get after running the program
- "cop3502-as1-eddy-joseph.c" - c file that contains the main function and logic behind the program
- "cop3502-as1-input.txt" - a sample input file read in by the program, can be changed to user's desire but must retain name
- "cop3502_as1.h" - header file containing structs needed to run program
- "leak_detector_c.c" - c file that contains code that detects memory leaks in program and ouputs leaks to a .txt file
- "leak_detector_c.h" - header file for leak detector
- "SU2022 COP3502 Programming Assignment 1.pdf" - scope and parameters of project as defined by the professor
- "screenshot.png" - my grade for this project (100%)

This assignment uses dynamic memory allocation, pointers, and pointer arrays in the C coding language to estimate data regarding monsters in regions of a fictional world akin to "Pokemon". A text file containing information specified by the user is read into the program to give fictional "monster trainers" an estimate of how many monsters can be captured per region in the fictional world. To find out more about the scope and parameters of this project, please read the "SU2022 COP3502 Programming Assignment 1.pdf" file
